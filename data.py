    1: 'Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van '
       'Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, '
       'notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and '
       'large scales.',
    2: 'Ruby is a dynamic, interpreted, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was '
       'designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan. According to the creator, '
       'Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. It supports multiple programming paradigms, '
       'including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory '
       'management.',
    3: 'C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward '
       'compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to '
       'machine instructions, and to require minimal run-time support. Despite its low-level capabilities, '
       'the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program that is '
       'written with portability in mind can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms and operating '
       'systems with few changes to its source code. The language has become available on a very wide range of '
       'platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers.',
    4: 'Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, '
       'and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let '
       'application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all '
       'platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to '
       'bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.',
    5: 'Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript '
       'enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of '
       'websites use it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it. As a '
       'multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including '
       'object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, '
       'regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, '
       'such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it '
       'is embedded. Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded in '
       'many other types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web '
       'programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make JavaScript available '
       'for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.'
